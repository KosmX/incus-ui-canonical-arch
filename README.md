# incus-ui-canonical

Canonical UI build for Incus on Arch Linux  

Arch now has an [incus-ui](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/incus-ui/) package, this is no longer needed. Please use the official package instead of this.


## This is not my work, I just used already existing code to make a PKGBUILD

Sources:  
LXD UI: [canonical/lxd-ui](https://github.com/canonical/lxd-ui)  
Incus patches: [zabbly/incus](https://github.com/zabbly/incus)  
The PKGBUILD is my work :3
